Next Soup Exchange - Next Date TBA.  Please let Mary Edson if you’d like to be added to our list to receive soup, or to let her know if you won’t be picking up soup that week.  Please also contact Mary Edson if you are interested in offering volunteer support and/or donations for this Ministry.</li><br/>
<li><br/>
Farmworker Caravan--The next Farmworker Caravan from San Jose to Watsonville takes place on Saturday, August 7th.  Please bring in any food donations marked “FWC”to Mary Edson at the Food Pantry no later than August 6th by Noon. The caravan helps so many people who work hard to bring food to our tables. Any donations are welcome. Thank You!</li><br/>
<li><br/>
Please remember to consider your privacy and the privacy of others regarding prayers and personal information. Let Faith know if your prayer should appear on the Prayer Chain email. You can also email your prayers for our community to prayerchain@campbellucc.org</li><br/>
<li><br/>
Please be aware that today’s service is streamed online via Zoom, and recorded for our archives. The recording will be available to our congregation members to view upon request. Please contact Ken True if you wish to view the recording.</li><br/>
<li><br/>
We are delighted that our choir has resumed singing. All choir members are vaccinated and are wearing protective masks especially designed for singing. In order to best protect all participants in our worship today, we respectfully request that non-choir members continue to refrain from singing for the time being. We ask this because:<ul><br/>
<li><br/>
COVID-19 is still potentially lethal for those who are unvaccinated;</li><br/>
<li><br/>
vaccinated people can still carry and transmit COVID-19;</li><br/>
<li><br/>
singing indoors still has potential for creating super-spreader events among those who are unvaccinated, and could lead to increased break-through infections for those who are vaccinated;</li><br/>
<li><br/>
regular disposable and cloth masks do not offer the same level of protection as the choirs' masks do;</li><br/>
<li><br/>
CUCC does not currently require checking the vaccination status of all worship participants, and there may be unvaccinated folks in our midst at any given time.</li><br/>
</ul></li><br/>
<li><br/>
We thank you for working with us to protect the health and wellbeing of all our participants, including children and adults who cannot be vaccinated due to age, health, or other reasons.</li><br/>
<li><br/>
You are invited to participate in the Oikos Program for all who are inspired to work with the congregation on congregational renewal efforts. Please speak with our Moderator, Mark Fanucchi, for more details.</li><br/>

<!-- extraText='In the days when the judges ruled, there was a famine in the land, and a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to live in the country of Moab, he and his wife and two sons. <br/>
<br/>
The name of the man was Elimelech and the name of his wife Naomi, and the names of his two sons were Mahlon and Chilion; they were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went into the country of Moab and remained there. <br/>
<br/>
But Elimelech, the husband of Naomi, died, and she was left with her two sons. These took Moabite wives; the name of the one was Orpah and the name of the other Ruth. When they had lived there about ten years, <br/>
<br/>
both Mahlon and Chilion also died, so that the woman was left without her two sons and her husband. <br/>
<br/>
Then she started to return with her daughters-in-law from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab that the <span style="text-transform: uppercase;font-size: smaller;">Lord</span> had considered his people and given them food. <br/>
<br/>
So she set out from the place where she had been living, she and her two daughters-in-law, and they went on their way to go back to the land of Judah. <br/>
<br/>
But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back each of you to your mother’s house. May the <span style="text-transform: uppercase;font-size: smaller;">Lord</span> deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead and with me. <br/>
<br/>
The <span style="text-transform: uppercase;font-size: smaller;">Lord</span> grant that you may find security, each of you in the house of your husband.” Then she kissed them, and they wept aloud. They said to her, “No, we will return with you to your people.” <br/>
<br/>
But Naomi said, “Turn back, my daughters, why will you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb that they may become your husbands? <br/>
<br/>
Turn back, my daughters, go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. Even if I thought there was hope for me, even if I should have a husband tonight and bear sons, <br/>
<br/>
would you then wait until they were grown? Would you then refrain from marrying? No, my daughters, it has been far more bitter for me than for you, because the hand of the <span style="text-transform: uppercase;font-size: smaller;">Lord</span> has turned against me.” <br/>
<br/>
Then they wept aloud again. Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. So she said, “See, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; return after your sister-in-law.” <br/>
<br/>
But Ruth said, “Do not press me to leave you or to turn back from following you! Where you go, I will go; where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God. <br/>
<br/>
Where you die, I will die— there will I be buried. May the <span style="text-transform: uppercase;font-size: smaller;">Lord</span> do thus and so to me, and more as well, if even death parts me from you!” <br/>
<br/>
When Naomi saw that she was determined to go with her, she said no more to her. <br/>
<br/>
So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they came to Bethlehem, the whole town was stirred because of them; and the women said, “Is this Naomi?” <br/>
<br/>
She said to them, “Call me no longer Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt bitterly with me. <br/>
<br/>
I went away full, but the <span style="text-transform: uppercase;font-size: smaller;">Lord</span> has brought me back empty; why call me Naomi when the <span style="text-transform: uppercase;font-size: smaller;">Lord</span> has dealt harshly with me, and the Almighty has brought calamity upon me?” <br/>
<br/>
So Naomi returned together with Ruth the Moabite, her daughter-in-law, who came back with her from the country of Moab. They came to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.' -->

And I will soar with You, <br/>
Your Spirit leads me on<br/>
In the Power of Your love<br/>
<br/>
Lord, unveil my eyes<br/>
Let me see You face to face<br/>
The knowledge of Your love<br/>
As You live in me<br/><br/>
Lord, renew my mind<br/>
As Your Will unfolds in my life<br/>
In living everyday<br/>
By the Power of Your love<br/>
<br/>
Hold me close, <br/>
let Your love surround me<br/>
Bring me near, <br/>
draw me to Your side<br/><br/>
And as I wait, <br/>
I'll rise up like the eagle<br/>
And I will soar with You, <br/>
Your Spirit leads me on<br/>
In the Power of Your love<br/>
<br/>
And I will soar with You, <br/>
Your Spirit leads me on<br/>
In the Power of Your love<br/>

We are trying to be curious. We are here trying to build connections in this lonely and isolated world.<br/>
We want to be somewhere other than here.We want to be standing in a place and time that is closer to your promised day—<br/>
where all are fed, the prisoners are freed, <br/>
the homeless are housed, <br/>
and every person knows their worth.<br/>
And we know we can’t get there without honest and vulnerable conversation, but we don’t always know what to ask. <br/>

So today we ask for your words.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Naomi: </strong>Plant questions in us that, like seeds, grow into a garden of connection. Plant affirmation in us that, like laughter, is contagious and mood-changing. Plant curiosity in us that, like rain, washes away any judgment we carry,replacing it with a desire to understand.<br/>
And when we have your words in our mouth, and your mind in our hearts, then teach us how to listen.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Jenn: </strong>Teach us how to hear the message under the words—the grief, the hurt, the fear, the shame that hangs under sentences like bats under a bridge. Help us to hear and make space for those unspoken truths.<br/>
Then teach us how to listen to voices that differ from us—voices with different opinions, with different histories, with different perspectives. So that like Ruth and Naomi, we might move through disagreement and ultimately find you.<br/>

With ev'ry breath I take<br/>
I will give thanks<br/>
to God above<br/>
For as long as<br/>
I shall live<br/>
I will testify to love<br/>
