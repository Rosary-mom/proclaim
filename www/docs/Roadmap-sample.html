<p class="section"><strong>Scripture text: Luke 14:7–14 (NRSV)</strong></p>
<p class="service">When he noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them a parable. <br/>
<br/>
“When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, do not sit down at the place of honor, in case someone more distinguished than you has been invited by your host; <br/>
<br/>
and the host who invited both of you may come and say to you, ‘Give this person your place,’ and then in disgrace you would start to take the lowest place. <br/>
<br/>
But when you are invited, go and sit down at the lowest place, so that when your host comes, he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher’; then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at the table with you. <br/>
<br/>
For all who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.” <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He said also to the one who had invited him, “When you give a luncheon or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors, in case they may invite you in return, and you would be repaid. <br/>
<br/>
But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. <br/>
<br/>
And you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”</p>

In the Christian tradition an “Agape” is also the name for informal meals, times of togetherness and mutual sharing which remind us of all those Early Christian “Love Feasts” and the sense of bounty and unity the Spirit continues to give us.</p>

<strong>Pastor:</strong><br/>
As you have feasted at the table at God’s invitation, <br/>
go into the world renewed and restored. <br/>
Go into the world to share the Good News <br/>
that there is a place for everyone at God’s banquet table. <br/>
Go into the world to share God’s bounty. Amen. <br/>
